When you¡¯ve been gone all day and your dog doesn¡¯t greet you at the door when you get home
Seems like people forget that being happy for other people¡¯s success is ok and doesn¡¯t affect your own
I can¡¯t believe home 2.0 happen today, it feels like a dream
Don¡¯t trust her cookie, don¡¯t ever trust her empire
Vegans can¡¯t eat anything but cardboard and dry wall
New days, don¡¯t forget the lessons of yesterday, keep shining
You are the best girlfriend ever I don¡¯t deserve you
Always be positive, don¡¯t waste your time on nonsense, don¡¯t let negative people distract you
If you breath it¡¯s because I give you air
We miss you, can¡¯t wait to see what you¡¯ve been working on
